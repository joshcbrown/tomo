tomo is a terminal UI pomodoro timer and task manager for macOS.

it serves as a successor to my previous project [pogodoro](https://github.com/joshcbrown/pogodoro), which i had a number of issues with. at some later stage, i'll come back here and motivate the changes i've made. in the meantime, below is a video that shows most of the app's functionality as of 22/8/25:
